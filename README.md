# GUESS-THE-NUMBER-IN-JAVA
This is a binary-search based game with graphic interface,in romanian.All you have to do is to run these two files in an IDE like INTELLIJ,and guess a number from
0 to 1000(inclusive) in at most 10 trials(it is proven you can guess the number in at most [log2(1000)]+1 trials).The game rules will be shown on the blue interface,and if you wanna see what number was randomly generated,change the directory at line 80 with your desired directory.Have fun!
